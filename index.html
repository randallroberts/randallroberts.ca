                        I started out coding as a hobby in public school, in the late 90's. Those early days were often spent in QBasic and Pascal, making small games like Monopoly or text-based dungeon crawlers. Over the years, I explored more mature languages and larger projects in a long list of programming languages.

                        While attending the University of Guelph (2004-2008), I achieved my Computing & Information Sciences degree with Honours, where I developed a familiarity with Java and C, while somehow finding the time to:

                        In my professional career, I wore several hats in web dev for approximately 7 years, primarily in PHP-driven CMS development (Joomla, Wordpress), and backend work in SQL/Oracle environments and Salesforce development (APEX, SOQL). These days, I'm playing a lot in Javascript, with multiple projects on the go in React and Angular. Given my background in SQL-heavy projects, I've also started learning more about NoSQL solutions.

                        Because of my background in competitive Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (8+ years), I then pursued an entrepreneurial career, having founded an eCommerce (Grapple Gear) which far exceeded my expectations for approximately 6 years, until I decided to return to my core skillset as a developer. In order to refresh my skillset, I pursued a diploma at Brainstation for web development, and re-familiarized myself with Javascript, as well as React, Express, and a long list of other tech stacks I'm now rabidly consuming in my own personal projects.
